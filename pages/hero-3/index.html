                <h1>Newt Scamander</h1>
                <p>“Imperfect understanding is often more dangerous than ignorance.”</p>
                <p>Newt Scamander cares deeply for his magical creatures. As a Magizoologist, that’s expected, but Newt goes above and beyond for them. When they’re in danger, Newt is the first to leap to their defense. He explains that there is nothing to fear. They will do harm as long as they are left alone and treated well. And Newt is happy to take the blame, the fall, or the punishment so long as his magical creatures are safe. Thus this quote summarizes Newt Scamander in two succinct sentences.</p>
